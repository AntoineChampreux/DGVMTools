\title{Perform biome classification using this ModelObject}
\usage{
calcBiomes(input, scheme)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{The ModelObject for which to calculate the biomes.}

\item{scheme}{The biome scheme to use.}
}
\value{
A new ModelObject with the biomes
}
\description{
This is very inflexible as it only allows the calcualtion of biomes with only one Quantity.  This is not suitable for many biomes schemes, 
so this will need to be re-written
