}
\arguments{
\item{runs}{List of VegRun objects to be compared}

\item{veg.spatial.id}{Character string holding the id of the VegObject to be compared}

\item{layer}{The layer to be compared across all VegRuns}

\item{expand.layer}{Logical, if TRUE expand the layer arguments use \code{expandLayers}}

\item{base.run.id}{A character string to which (if specified) all the other runs are compared by plotting the difference 
and percentage difference relative to this base run}

\item{abs.value.cuts}{A numeric vector which (if specified), defines the cuts for the plot of the absolute values of each 
run on one figure}

\item{plot.diff}{Logical, if TRUE and a base.run.id supplied, plot the absolute difference of each run relative to the base run.}

\item{diff.cuts}{A numeric vector which (if specified), defines the cuts for the difference plot of each run compared to the base run}

\item{plot.perc.diff}{Logical, if TRUE and a base.run.id supplied, plot the percentage difference of each run relative to the base run.}

\item{perc.diff.cuts}{A numeric vector which (if specified), defines the cuts for the percentage difference plot of each run compared to the base run}

\item{special}{A character string which, if specified, is used to give special plotting instructions to \code{plotVegMaps}, 
see the documentation of that function for details.}

\item{single.page}{Logical, if TRUE, put all "sub-layers" on one plot instead of separate individual plots.}

\item{tag}{A character string to identify this plot/analysis in comparison to others, eg. "SoilDepthTests" or "NewSLAForumalation"}

\item{canvas.options}{A list of options (to be given to the \code{Cairo}) function to define the canvas. See the \code{Cairo} documentation}

\item{summary.plot.dir}{A directory (full path as a character string) so save the plots which compare many runs}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the \code{plotVegMaps} function.}
}
\description{
Given a list of runs and an id of a spatial VegObjects, compare the specified layers between all runs, and, 
if a base line run is specified, also plot comprisons relative to that
