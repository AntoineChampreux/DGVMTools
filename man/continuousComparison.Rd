\item{x}{A data.table containing the spatial-temporal-annual columns and two columns containg the data to be compared}

\item{layers1}{A character string giving the first layer to compare (should be a column in x)}

\item{layers2}{A character string giving the second layer to compare (should be a column in x)}

\item{additional}{A list of functions define additions metrics, see the custom.metrics argument of \code{compareLayers()}}

\item{verbose}{A logical, if TRUE print out all the metric scores

Note that there are many other slots in a Statistics object which will not be filled in the resulting object because they are not for continuous data.}
