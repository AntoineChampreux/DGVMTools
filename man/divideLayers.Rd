\title{Calculate fractions from the layers of a ModelObject with respect to other layers}
\usage{
divideLayers(input, layers, denominators = list("Total"))
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{The ModelObject for which to calculate the new fractional layers}

\item{layers}{The layers to be divided ie. the numerators (will be calculated by \code{getVegTotals} if the don't exist)}

\item{denominators}{The denominator layers (will be calculated by \code{getVegTotals} if the don't exist) (defaults to just "Total")}
}
\value{
A ModelObject (or data.table) with the new layers added
}
\description{
This is very useful and important function.  It is fully flexible  -both the numerator and denominator can be specified (although the denominator defaults to "Total").
Note that if a layer doesn't exist it will be created if possible.
}
\details{
Division is safe with respect to a zero denominator, the results of dividing by zero is, in this case, zero.

For convenience, both \code{layers} and \code{denominators} will be expanded using \code{expandLayers}.
This allows all lifeforms fractions in a ModelObject to be calculated using a simple call such as

 \code{veg.obj <- divideLayers(veg.obj, c("lifeforms")}
 
See documention of \code{expandLayers} for details.
